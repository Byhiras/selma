/**
 * Define a fieldname based mapping.

 * You can use a CustomMapper here using withCustom = CustomMapper.class. This mapper
 * will be used to convert the defined field pair.
 * @Field({"name", "firstname"}, withCustom = MyCustomMapper.class) will map name to firstname
 * and reverse using the eligible custom mapper method.
 * <p/>
 * To simplify custom field to field mappers, Selma allows to define only one value when withCustom
 * is declared. This can be usefull when you want to define a specific mapper for a property defined
 * in both source and destination.
 * @Field({"name"}, withCustom = MyCustomMapper.class) will map name to name using the eligible
